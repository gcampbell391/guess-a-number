# Guess a number 

A simple Number Guessing Game created with React Native. A user selects a number between 1-99
to start the game. Once the game begins the computer will begin guessing the user's number. After each
computer guess, the user will tell the computer whether their guess was higher or lower compared to their
number(the number picked at the beginning of the game by the user). The game is over as soon as the computer 
guess the user's number. It's a simple game to see how long it takes the computer to guess your number!
